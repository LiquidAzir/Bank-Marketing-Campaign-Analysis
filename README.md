# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

In this analysis, I examined a dataset from a bank's marketing campaign to understand the factors influencing clients' decisions to subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset contains demographic and economic variables, along with details of the marketing contacts. My objective was to identify patterns and predictors of positive responses to the campaign.

I began with exploratory data analysis, revealing a class imbalance with a higher proportion of clients declining the term deposit. Key variables like age, contact duration, and economic indices showed varied influences. Models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM were employed to predict client responses. Through hyperparameter tuning, I optimized each model's performance.

Key findings suggest that longer contact durations and certain economic conditions are significant predictors. The imbalance in the target variable was a notable challenge, potentially skewing predictive accuracy.

For next steps, I recommend focusing on strategies to balance the dataset, perhaps through oversampling techniques. Further, exploring more advanced models or ensemble methods could yield improved predictions. Insights from this analysis should guide more targeted and efficient future marketing strategies, enhancing response rates and overall campaign effectiveness.
